### About Me

I am just another normal person who likes to play Minecraft and Terraria among other games. I also like using Linux (arch btw) and dabbling in some open source projects.
I may not be that good at coding (I just know some Python and some C/C++), but I try my best and hope I improve in the future.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I sneeze a lot, but you didn't have to know that
