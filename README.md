### About Me

I am just another normal person who likes to code a little . I also like using Linux and dabbling in some open source projects.
I may not be that good at coding (I just know some Python and some C/C++), but I try my best and hope I improve in the future.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ~~I sneeze a lot, but you didn't have to know that~~ Yay! My sinusitis seems to have died down, now I don't sneeze that much.

#### Notice: I won't be able to use my phone or laptop until my SSC exam (2023) is over, so don't expect to see me online until after 2023 march or something
